      <p>
        &emsp; My name is Angel Martin Demerutis I was born in Tucson AZ, but I was raised in Mexico. At the age of 14 I was sent to a military school in Roswell NM. After highschool I came to Tucson to finish my studies. I received a Bachelors degree in Business Administration from NAU with a 3.22 GPA.

        &emsp; One of my passions is real estate, that's why in 2016 I obtained my real estate license in the state of Arizona. I look forward to the day I become a great real estate investor. In the meantime, I focus in coding one of my many passions. I decided to join the coding bootcamp at the University of Arizona to obtain the knowledge required to be a great web developer.
